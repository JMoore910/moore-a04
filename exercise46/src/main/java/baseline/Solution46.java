/*
    Create an application that opens a text file for input,
    reads the text file into an ArrayList of Strings,
    then, loop through the arraylist to create a list of type WordOccurrences,
    a class data structure which stores a string, and an int number of times
    that string has been read.
    next, loop through that list to find the most commonly occurring word.
    loop to print a number of stars corresponding to how many times it has been read,
    then remove that word from the list
    //  Classes: WordOccurrences
    //           ReadFromFile
    //           ProcessList
